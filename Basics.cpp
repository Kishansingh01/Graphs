// Graphs-> A graph is a collection of nodes where each node might 
// or might not point to other nodes.
// The nodes represent the real life entities.And are connected by 
// edges representing relationship between the nodes/entities.

// In tchenical terms that nodes are called vertices 
// and the relation is called the edges.

// Usage:->Google maps,Electrical engeneering(Circuit organisation),biology(protein-protein),different connections.

// In mathematical term we can use the graph is an ordered pair of set v and set E rpresently vertics and 
// edges respectively  Graph=(V,E).

      Types of Graph

      1) Prespective to Direction 

      a) Undirected graph 
      b)Directed graph
Undirected graph ->Where edges have no direction it is directly connected with each other.Ex->Facebook , one user 
has send request to another user and another user has accept the request .Now they both  become the friend.This 
is the example of undirected graph.



Directed graph ->Where edges have direction it is connected with each other in one direction.Ex->  Instagram,
One user has send follow request to another user and another user has accept but he has not follow him back. So,
this is the example of directed graph.


       2) Prespective of weightage

       a)Weighted graph
       b)Unweighted graph

Weighted graph:->Mtlb edges or vertices ke beech relationship, like agar facebook pr ek saal ka duration other 
user ke saath friend hai to uske beech ek relation hai jo weighted graph ko batata hai.Like do edges ke beech 
quantitative measurable hm define karte hai.



                    //   GRAPHS TERMENOLOGIES
    
    Multigraph->An undirected graph in which multiple edges ar allowed between two nodes.Mtlb do nodes ke beech 
    multiple edges ho sakte hai.


   Simple graph-> An undirected graph in which both multiple 
   edges and loops are not allowed between two nodes.

   Complete graph-> A  complete graph is the one in which every node is 
   directly connected to the every other node.

   Connected Graph->In this graph we have a Direct or Indirect path for 
   every possible pair of vertex

   Path-> path is a graph whose vertices can be arranged in a 
   sequence such that every two consecutive vertices are adjacent.

   DAG(directed acyclic graph)=>Which is directed and acyclic graph.
   Cycle->A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

   Degree->Degree of a vertex in a graph is the total number of
   edges incident to it or away from it. 

   Indegree->Means how many of edges are coming to that particular node.

   Outdegree->Means how many of degree are going through that particular node. 

   Trees->It is a connected graph with no cycles.If we 
   remove an edge from a tree, it will become disconnected it will be called forest.
          Edges = Node -1
           |E|=|V|-1
    forest |E|=|V|-1(max)



   If there is a disconnected graph then the set of vertices 
   which are connected forms a connected component.
