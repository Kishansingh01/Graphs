// Breadth first search(Queue)->  In BFS we watch that any process 
// which is happening is process immediate neighbours ,means which 
// edge of the node is  coming firstso thats why we go foe FIFO
//which is nothing but the queue algorithms we will use.Means when i am 
// inserting that node make that node into marked.

// Shortest path i can do from breadth first traversal.
